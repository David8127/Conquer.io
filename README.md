## Description

AS A company that sells products across the United States
I WANT to have an application that will allow me to track where all of my products buyers are, see which ones I have done business with, and see which ones are no longer interested in my product
SO THAT I can assess where I can cut out a marketing budget and focus on the spread of my product.

## Instructions

In order to get started, you must clone the repository and then run 

'npm i'

to install your dependencies.

## Usage

For businesses who depend on B2B models or for personal leisure, Conquer.io is a upcoming technology that is able to map out databases, CRMs, random addresses and allow you to pinpoint them on a map. 

Managing sales data from a CRM can be challenging for businesses. It’s difficult to get a clear picture of the sales pipeline and track progress overtime. 
Sales managers often spend a lot of time manually compiling reports and analyzing data in order to make informed decisions.
It’s hard to know which lead has the highest value without visual reports.
